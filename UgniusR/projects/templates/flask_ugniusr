<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
The purpose of the site is to have an open-ended platform to experiment and showcase/document new projects. The full
source code can be found through the link on the bottom of this page.
</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>
The site is built on Linux, Apache, mySQL, and Python (Flask).
</p>

<h3>Why not MEAN?</h3>
<p>
While I acknowledge the existence and importance of the modern Javascript options (Angular/Node.js), my priority has
never been front-end development. For the purpose of this project, the current technology is sufficient and allows
me to become familiar with the fundamentals.

<p>
I find it is the best use of my time to expand my knowledge of my current interests. If someday my interest in Javascript
frameworks grows, this website would very likely be the target of experimentation.
